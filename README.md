Here is the code from the Internet Programming 2021 tutorials (2nd part).

You have two options:
1. Download the .zip file, unpack it and use it
2. Or, clone the git repository. 
  In order to do this you will have to install git on your computer and then clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/UISTRepo/expressAPI`, and then with every new code update you can `git pull`
3. After you get the code, make sure to run "npm install" in the root project directory to install the node modules.
